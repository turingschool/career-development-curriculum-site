### Discipline, Hustle, and Skill

In this session we'll work on HUSTLE -- the work it takes to find a potential employer, convince them you're worth the time to interview, and just maybe even hire.

## Why

There's only about a 1 in 4 chance that the job you eventually take will have been posted.

When you only read job listings, you're *passively* waiting for more/better ones to be posted. Putting in more time means little additional possibility unless you broaden/lower your expectations.

If you can job hunt beyond listings, then you're *actively* searching. The more time you put in, the deeper you dig, the more possibilities you find.

## How

### Developer Job Listings

* Job listings are still worth something
* Junior jobs are heavily applied
* Applying for "senior" jobs that match your niche
* The "dummy"/"fishing" senior job posting
* You're either hiring or you're dying

#### Practice

Pick a city/region other than Denver/Boulder (it can just be for practice!) or SF and:

* Find a local "hip" news source similar to Westword or Built In Colorado
* Find a set of awards that they've given in the last two years ("Company of the Year", "Best Places to Work")
* Did you know that companies typically pay or self-advocate/nominate to win these?
* Find at least five companies from these lists
* Are they hiring developers? Are there clues that they have developers? Do they sponsor things? Do they have a technical blog? Open source? What technologies to do they use?

### Stepping Out of the Mainstream

* Ruby? JavaScript? You're more common than you used to be.
* The necessary lie of `jobs@company.com`
* Developer jobs come in lots of shapes and sizes
* How is a job listing born?
* Diving deeper than developer job listings
* Consider the less-attractive technology/industry
* The devs there have more options than you do
* Any industry connection is a huge hook/differentiator

#### Practice

* What kind of job experience do you have? Brainstorm three domains where that experience could possibly be relevant. If you were a bartender, you might come up with "Point of Sale Systems", "Inventory/Fulfillment Processing", and "Customer Happiness/Success".
* Can you find two place for each of your domains where your experience could be an asset?
* Python, Java, and .NET are not hard to pick up. Can you find three companies who sound super interesting except that they use one of these languages?
* If you had three days to learn one of these languages, what resources would you use? Actually find the links and record them.

### Community Building

* Developers are getting old...and in charge
* Local > Global
* Where is the community coming together?
* Meetups & Conferences: who attends? who speaks? who sponsors?
* Look for a gathering that has between 10 and 50 attendees -- these are community advocates
* Track them on Twitter, GitHub/Email, don't bother with LinkedIn

#### Practice

* What's a topic that you're interested in, not necessarily expert in, that attracts people? Data visualization? OpenGov? A certain language or framework? Entrepreneurs? A certain demographic in tech?
* Find a meetup in a place you're interested in that is focused on that niche
* Find the events that have happened in the last three months
* Who spoke?
* Who sponsored?
* Who RSVPed?
* All of these are worth investigating and attempting to contact
* Use our GitHub techniques to find two people that you'll *reach out to TODAY*

### Closing

* You've gotta sell when they're in the buying mood
* Discipline keeps you ready to succeed
* Hustle gets you connected to potential
* Skill gets you a job
