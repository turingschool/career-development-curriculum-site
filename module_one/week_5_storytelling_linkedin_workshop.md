---

### Overview
This is your final PD activity during this module. By the end of today, there are 2 goals for you to achieve:

* A working version of your professional story
* A working draft of your LinkedIn profile

What should a working draft of a LinkedIn profile look like? The minimum requirements are:

* Headshot 
* Headline updated to include your software identity
* Summary section to tell your professional story
* Turing added to both Experience and Education sections

For all the details on how to build an effective LinkedIn profile, check out the guidelines at the [top of this page](/resources/branding_resources)

### Workshop Guidelines
This workshop takes place during Week 5 Homeroom.

1. Revisit your norms as a group to understand how you'll approach feedback with each other in this space (5 mins)
2. Status check (10 mins)
   * Share where each person is when it comes to their professional story:
      * On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about sharing your professional story? 
      * What areas do you feel most confident in when sharing your professional story?
      * What areas do you want to improve on when sharing your professional story?
   * Share where each person is in completing their LinkedIn rough draft:
      * If you haven't started your LinkedIn profile or made updates yet this module, this is what you should spend time on first.
      * If you have already gotten the minimum requirements completed on your LinkedIn, focus on:
          * Adding contacts (with a note!)
          * Creating a post about a recent project
          * [Looking ahead to how you'll structure your resume](/resources/resume_resources)
3. Work time on your LinkedIn (15 mins)
4. Each person shares their professional story and/or LinkedIn profile and the group provides feedback that is **specific, actionable, and kind** (20 mins):
   * What is working well? Examples: strong understanding of why they are changing careers; know what transferable skills they bring from their previous experiences; understand the kinds of technologies they are currently learning/specialize in; 
   * What could be improved? Examples: it's not clear yet why you changed careers to become a software developer; it's not clear what kind of software developer you are; it's not clear what kinds of jobs you are looking for.
5. Use the last 10 minutes to make updates based on the feedback you received. 

### Next Steps
Next module, you'll start to focus on your resume. Please make it a priority for your LinkedIn to be in good shape before the next module starts. If you have any questions on this, please reach out to Allison.
