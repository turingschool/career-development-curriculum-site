## Week 3 Lesson: Professional Storytelling & Branding

We've been focusing on your strengths and how you work, both at Turing and in previous experiences. In this lesson, we'll build off of those conversations to craft a compelling story that describes who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community in order to build connections for your future career.

From your professional story, we'll craft your LinkedIn summary, your resume, and your Terminal portfolio. And this is how you can inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.

Personal branding is the act of telling a consistent story about yourself, building out the details of this story with each profile. As you start this new career, telling your story as a new member of the software industry in as many consistent ways as possible will help you stand out and embrace that identity even more.

### Section 1: Professional Storytelling

We are all inherent storytellers. Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry?

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, shared her [22 rules for storytelling here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/pixar-tips-brave-artist-emma-coats-shares-her-storytelling-wit-and-wisdom-on-twitter%20followher/2012/06/25/gJQADaxd2V_blog.html), and we'll use some of them to apply them to our storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

*Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.*

**Action Item:** Take a few minutes before moving on to the next video to answer the questions on [this note-taking sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nji0XRnS1hGrlDD_PYJiOsF3ACpyNtMYkOGN1L9EPo/edit?usp=sharing) about a story that is meaningful to you and why you connect with it. Pulling apart this story will help you think about how you can connect with others through your own story.  

### Section 2: Develop Your Professional Story

Taking more lessons from Pixar as well as storytelling theory from Joseph Campbell, most stories (in the western tradition at least) follow the 3-Act Arc. Your story should too!

**Act I (Set-Up)**
* Introduction
* Inciting incident
* Turning point

**Act II (Struggle)**
* Obstacles & Crisis
* Looking for ways to solve the problem
* Learning what it will take to actually solve problem

**Act III (Finale)**
* Climax
* Denouement/Resolution
* Show what’s been learned
* Protagonist is changed

#### Create Your 3 Acts
To understand your own story and character arc, use the following questions to help you create that act structure:

1. **Act I: Who are you?** (as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)
2. **Act II: Why are you here?** (Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)
3. **Act III: What's next?** (Where do you see yourself going in this career?)

Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

Your story is one of *transition*. These stories are inherently interesting as they have all the elements of a classic story, and most importantly, they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition. Where are you going? What will happen next? It's so exciting for the listener! But it also depends on how you tell that story.

**Disclaimer:** When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring.

#### Examples
During a networking event explored in this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story), senior managers who'd been downsized took turns telling what they had done before and what they were looking for next. Here are some takeaways:

* Stories that only recap a list of a person's resume are **not** interesting to the listener ("First I did this, then I did this, then I did this...")
* Stories that focus more on character motives, themes, and turning points -- the moments that cause your listener to ask, "What happened next?" -- are compelling to a listener.

As you continue to refine your professional story, consider your audience for different contexts and identify a theme that can connect your values and goals with the audience. 
 
#### Know your Audience 
Depending on the context, your story will change a little. Think about each of these scenarios and how you might adjust your story depending on your audience:

* Meet and greet networking event
* 1:1 coffee chat
* Formal interview

When you're meeting with someone from a specific company, adjust your story to discuss how that company fits into it. Conduct research to figure out: 

 * What is happening with specific industries that you are interested in? 
 * What is happening within specific companies?
 * What current challenges are important to these businessess and teams? 
 
#### Decide on a Theme
Consider your values and motivations: what is something that connects your career path together? What is one theme you want employers to take away after talking with you or reading your LinkedIn profile or resume? 

 * What are your top strengths, values, and accomplishments?
 * What value will you bring to a company? 

### Section 3: Telling Your Story Through Branding

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJM4okCLpns" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Branding is telling a consistent story. You can also think about it as a process of differentiating yourself by identifying and articulating who you are with a consistent message used across platforms in order to reach a goal, such as furthering your career.

Essentially, you are your brand. This includes your image, your mission, your values, and your vision! Developing your brand is done by authentically marketing yourself and gaining visibiity on social media. 

As a career changer, your story = your brand = your rebrand! Your goal is to stay true and authentic to who you are and lead with your strengths and values.  What impression or story about yourself do want to create as you get rooted in the tech industry?

Why is this important? According to the online reputation management consultancy, [BrandYourself](https://brandyourself.com/):

* 82% of business decision makers said that presence in search results was an influential factor when vetting people online.
* 42% of US adults looked someone up before deciding to do business with them.
* 27% have searched for someone they met in a professional setting, such as a networking event.
* 23% of US adults have looked up a coworker.

#### Getting Clear on Your Brand
To help you think about what your public-facing story could include, create a holistic view of your career successes and accomplishments. Here are some additional questions to consider:

* What is your desired position in the industry? For example, a self-taught developer turned Rubyist or a Front-end developer with love for education. 
* What are your values and what do you want to achieve with your brand? For example, you might value accessible education, innovative web design, or customer-centered problem solving. 
* What technologies are you most passionate about? and Why? This answer will help you attract your audience. When your brand is clear and focused you will have indsutry professional seek you out. 
* What will your brand say about you on social media? 

Here are some [additional branding resources](/resources/branding_resources) for platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter.
