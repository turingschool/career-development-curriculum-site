title: Module 1 Professional Development
---

## Overview
Our approach to Mod 1 is to help you understand where to start in your professional development -- no matter where you come from when you start Turing, how can you set yourself up for success in this new career? We start by helping you define your strengths, goals, and professional story for your career transition into software. Mod 1 professional development is delivered through a combination of self-paced asynchronous sessions, small group discussion, office hours, and other check-ins. 

### Key Learning Goals
The following are covered in the Mod 1 curriculum from our 5 core competencies:

* **Networking:**
    * Create and describe your goals in networking
    * Understand how you want to grow your network and identify the next steps to take
    * Build connections in the Turing community through Homeroom groups, Mix It Up, and your mentor relationship
* **Interviewing:**
    * Build self-awareness around your background, strengths, values, and goals in order to describe them to others
* **Materials:**
    * Utilize your understanding of your story to create a strong LinkedIn profile

See more about these learning goals [here](/module_one/mod1_learning_goals).

## Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 1, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
