title: Module 1 Career Development
---

## Overview
In accordance with our mission, our objective is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

* Networking: Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
* Interviewing: The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
* Materials: A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
* Job Search Strategies: A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
* Negotiations: Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

All of these will be addressed in Module 1 through a [scaffolded approach](https://www.edglossary.org/scaffolding/#:~:text=In%20education%2C%20scaffolding%20refers%20to,independence%20in%20the%20learning%20process.). 

### Key Learning Goals
Core Competencies of Module 1:
* Build self-awareness around strengths and goals
* Build community through professional development
* Incorporate your mentor into job search support
* Establish sense of ownership over your professional development and job search

### Module 1 Outcomes
By the end of Module 1, we aim for students to achieve [Level I readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Materials, and Interviewing.

(Note: SIAT = Student is able to)

**Networking Level I:**
* SIAT describe their own needs in regards to their identity and networking
* SIAT formulate specific questions about the tech industry important to their experience and connect them to their career goals
* SIAT ask mentors questions about their jobs and career paths
* SIAT discuss career goals with mentor in at least two conversations

**Materials Level I:**
* SIAT understand what makes them a unique asset to the tech industry in order to pull out aspects of identity to highlight in LinkedIn
* SIAT create a LinkedIn profile that includes:
   * Professional-looking headshot
   * Headline updated
   * Summary statement
   * Turing added
  
*If a student has extenuating circumstances that preclude them from having a LinkedIn profile, the CD team will work with them on alternative options*

**Interviewing Level I:**
* SIAT describe how their identity influences their career goals
* SIAT describe their strengths as they see them in previous careers/experiences and in current work at Turing
* SIAT describe why they decided to pursue this career in basic terms (i.e., desire for career change, love of problem solving, etc.)
* SIAT reflect on and describe their approach to problem-solving in technical assessments

#### Deliverables to be completed by end of Module 1
* Students should have LinkedIn rough draft completed and get feedback from peers
* Students complete end of mod self-evaluation survey for CD team to assess support needs
* Portfolio review that includes self-evaluation

### What This Will Look Like Week-by-Week

* Sessions:
    * Week 1: [Understanding Your Developer Identity] -- Coming soon
    * Week 3: [Storytelling & Branding] -- Coming soon
* Activities:
    * Week 2: [Choose a Networking Activity to Complete](/module_one/week_2_networking_activity)
    * Week 4: [Complete a Follow-Up Networking Activity](/module_one/week_4_networking_activity)
    * Week 5: [Workshop LinkedIn profiles] -- Coming soon
* Weekly student discussion groups (see below!)

### Weekly Opportunities for Cohort & Community Collaboration
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 1, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 1, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
