## Week 2: Intro Networking Activity
There is no session this week! Instead, this week should be used to begin building your network, both within the Turing community and the tech industry. In order to fulfill expectations for this week, choose **one** of the following options to complete:

### Level I: Network with your Mentor
At this point, you should have already reached out to your mentor to introduce yourself and have a DTR. You may have already met a few times, but it's likely that those conversations were focused on your technical learning. But you can utilize your mentor for so much more! They have been in your shoes and know what it's like to be new to the industry. They are a wealth of knowledge and can provide you with ample advice. To network with your mentor, take the following steps:

* Set up a call with your mentor and let them know you specifically want to talk about their career experience. Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 
* Come up with some questions to ask them during the call. It can be helpful to send them the questions ahead of time so they can prepare for the conversation.
* Take notes during the conversation
* Decide on one takeaway from the conversation that you can follow up on. This might mean doing a little research into something they mention or asking for an introduction to someone from their network. 

Suggested questions/discussion prompts:

* Tell me about your background. How did you get started in the tech industry?
* When you were looking for your first software job, what strategies were successful for you? What strategies were not successful?
* What is the number one piece of advice you have for someone like me who is just starting out in this career?
* At your company, what do you look for in junior developers?
* What can junior developers do to help themselves stand out? 
* I'm not sure what industry/companies I'm interested in. Do you have any advice on how I could start to figure that out?
* I know I'm interested in ______ kind of work. Do you have any advice on how I could learn more about that?
* How did you figure out where you wanted to start with your first job? How has that influenced your career?
* Is there anyone you know who would be beneficial for me to talk to? Could you make an introduction for me? 

**Note:** your mentor may also be job searching, perhaps for their first tech job. They are still a great person to network with! They can share all of the strategies they have been trying already so that you can learn from their experience. 

When to complete this by:
* As soon as possible but by the end of Week 3 at the latest

### Level II: Network with a Contact You Already Know
Reach out to a contact from your existing network and ask to set up a call to discuss career advice. Who would be an ideal person for you to reach out? Someone in the tech industry (not necessarily a developer), someone who has changed careers before, or someone  This could also be another person in the Turing network but who isn't your mentor -- an alum who is in the same Student Circle as you, for example. Take the following steps to reach out:

* Send a message to this person. If you don't know them personally, take the time to introduce yourself and explain very clearly both what you want to talk to them about and *why* you specifically want to talk to them about this (as opposed to someone else). Why are they the right person for your questions? Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 
* Come up with some questions to ask them during the call. It can be helpful to send them the questions ahead of time so they can prepare for the conversation.
* Take notes during the conversation
* Decide on one takeaway from the conversation that you can follow up on. This might mean doing a little research into something they mention or asking for an introduction to someone from their network.

Depending on who you choose to reach out to, your questions will look different. Here are some suggested prompts to get you started:
* Tell me about your background. How did you get to where you are now?
* What is the number one piece of advice you have for someone like me who is changing careers/starting something new?
* Is there anyone you could recommend I talk to at your company or in the tech industry at large and why? Would you be able to make an introduction for me? 
*  


When to complete this by:
* As soon as possible but by the end of Week 3 at the latest

### Level III: Network with a Cold Contact
Reach out to someone who works at a company or in an industry that you are interested in. This could be a person who you have a mutual connection with or someone you don't have any connection to yet. Some suggestions about how to approach this:

* Utilize LinkedIn to find software developers from a company's page. You can decide if you want to reach out to someone who is junior or senior, and keep in mind that questions will be different depending on their level. 
* Send a LinkedIn message or find their email using resources on [this page](/resources/outreach_networking_resources) to introduce yourself and explain very clearly both what you want to talk to them about and *why* you specifically want to talk to them about this (as opposed to someone else). Why are they the right person for your questions? Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 

Suggestions for other junior developers:
* Tell me about your background. How did you get started in the tech industry?
* 

Suggestions for senior developers or hiring managers:
* Tell me about your background. How did you get started in the tech industry?
* At your company, what do you look for in junior developers?
* What can junior developers do to help themselves stand out? 
* What do you enjoy about this company/industry?
* What is the biggest problem facing your company/industry? 
* How does the software team work with other teams within the company? 

When to complete this by:
* As soon as possible but by the end of Week 3 at the latest

### FAQs

* What constitutes networking? Do I have to talk to someone in person/on a call? A: Networking is building a relationship. To do that, it involves having a conversation. The way that conversation takes place -- on a call, through email or Slack messages, DMs on Twitter -- is entirely up to you. 
* How do I go about contacting someone if I don't have their email? A: There are [several sites listed here](/resources/outreach_networking_resources) that can help you find people's email addresses. 
* What if my mentor is busy this week and we can't connect to do this activity? A: That is totally fine. Things happen. But you should still set up a time with them to complete this activity once they are free. Or you could complete the Level II activity with another person in the Turing community.
