title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 1
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

During your time in Mod 1 PD, we focused on building these core competencies:

* Build self-awareness around strengths and goals
* Build community through professional development
* Starting to build your network for job search support
* Establish sense of ownership over your professional development and job search

By the end of Module 1, we aim for students to achieve [Level I readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Materials, and Interviewing. While you repeat the module, this is an opportunity to continue this work and think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

## Expectations for Repeating the Module

### Sessions
You can access any of the previous sessions and rewatch videos from each session on the [Mod 1 main page](/module_one/index).

### House Groups on Wednesdays
You will continue to meet with the Mod 1 House groups on Wednesdays weeks 1, 3, and 5. This is an opportunity to build new networking relationships, support each other with professional development and the job search, and connect with each other. 

During this group time, some of the discussion topics will pertain to the session for that week. Even though you do not have to attend the sessions, you should contribute your ideas and reflections to the group and use the space to solicit feedback and collaboration on what you're working on. 

Reminder on [House Group expectations](/student_discussion_groups/).

### Suggestions for What to Work on
For this module, we suggest creating 2 [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What could these goals look like? 

#### Goal #1: Build a professional skill(s) that will contribute to your success at Turing.

Here are some examples:
  * Organization & time management
  * Communication
  * Project & priority management
  * Stress management
  * Take on a leadership role within your cohort through organizing study groups, leading a review session for the class, assisting SLC reps in facilitating cohort retros, organizing a non-coding social activity, etc.

#### Goal #2: Build a professional skill(s) that will contribute to your professional development and further your job search.

Here are some examples:
  * Networking:
     * Reflect on your personal feelings about networking
     * Define your own goals and needs in 1:1 networking situations
     * Outline a process for starting a conversation with your House mentors or another alum around career goals
     * Reach out to 1 alum or another person from the Turing community to ask questions about their careers and advice for your job search
  * Interviewing:
     * Refine your professional story using [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19JdLwk6ENV_Q6qvAlPMvMHoUVSIyLzYPp32pdaxL8Qg/edit?usp=sharing)
     * Practice your professional story with your homeroom group, mentor, or another person in your support system
     * Write out stories to describe each of your projects, including the objective of the project, the successes, the challenges, and what you learned that will make you a stronger developer. Keep these in an "interview prep" document to continue to add to as you go through the program
  * Materials:
     * Continue to update your LinkedIn according to [these guidelines](/resources/branding_resources)
     * Start on your resume following [this lesson from Mod 2](/module_two/mod2_week1)
     * Write a blog post about something you're learning that you can share on LinkedIn or Twitter for your networks

#### Template for Defining & Tracking Your Goals
Use this template to help you define and track your goals by copying and pasting the questions below into a document you can share with Allison or your homeroom group. 

* Specific (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?): 

* Measurable (How can you measure progress and know if youâ€™ve successfully met your goal?):

* Achievable (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?):

* Relevant (How does this goal connect to your larger career goals?):

* Timebound (When do you plan to achieve this goal by? Be specific and consider how realistic your expectations are):
