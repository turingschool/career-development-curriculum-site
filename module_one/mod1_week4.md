Linkedin is a social media tool you can use to:
* Tell your career story on digital platforms
* Communicate with recruiters, peers, and thought-leaders in your industry
* Connect with people to build your network
* Search for and apply to jobs online
* Research companies, employees, and available opportunities

### Section 2: Profile and Photos Overview
Per Linkedin, a complete profile has a current industry listed, at least 2 up-to-date positions with descriptions, a minimum of 3 skills, a profile picture, and at least 50 connections.

Profile Photo: Your profile photo should be easy to see your face and not cropped, 
blurry, or pixelated.

Cover Photo: The cover photo should showcase some of your personality or connect to 
your industry. Above all else, replace the standard Linkedin image.

### Section 3: Headlines and Keywords
When searching on Linkedin, your profile picture and headline are some of the first things people can see about you. They can inspire people to click on your profile and learn more about you.

## There are three typical types of headlines on Linkedin: 
Direct = Title of position at Company
Power Statement = title | benefit statement
Keyword Focused = Action | General title | General title 

Keyword Focused is the best option for job seekers as concentrated keywords can help attract specific individuals to your profile. 
If you’re looking for a job in software development but your headline and profile only showcase your previous industry experience in education, how will recruiters know to connect with you about work in software development?

## Examples
Software Engineer - UI/Java/JavaScript Developer - Front End 
Software Developer | Former Educator | B2B & B2C Customer Experience

### Section 4: Summary
A summary provides opportunities to tell the story you want the reader to know about you and your career journey.

Clearly define these items for the reader:
Who you are + How you got there + What’s next 

Close with an action item for those reading. What do you want people to do when they see your profile? Do you want them to look at your code, website, email you?

## Examples to Integrate into Your Summary
Hook: It took me more than X hours of studying to learn the secret about Y, but since then, something unexpected has happened."
Your Journey: "I grew up on the Mississippi River and watched it get clearer over time as manufacturing standards improved. Since then, I knew I wanted to spread the word about sustainability in business environments."

Accomplishments: "Over the past five years, I've made it into the President's Club three times and my closed-won business has seen less than 10% churn during the first 12 months."

Your Goals: “I'm a software engineer interested in assisting small teams in optimizing their time and workflows so businesses can grow without adding more headcount and reps can advance their careers.”

Action Item: "Reach me at email@address.com or book time on my calendar here: [Calendar link]."
