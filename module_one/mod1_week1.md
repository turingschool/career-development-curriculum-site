### Section 1: Introduction
For our first lesson in Mod 1, let's talk about why we're starting with discussing strengths. The core of developing yourself professionally is *understanding yourself* and *being able to speak to to that understanding.* You have to understand yourself in order to know what you're striving towards professionally as well as how to advocate for what you want.

These abilities will not only help you at Turing and serve as the foundation for your job search by helping you:

* Create a concise elevator pitch
* Have a compelling answer to “tell me about yourself” question
* Engage & connect with others
* Create a powerful statement or summary for your resume, LinkedIn and alumni profiles

How can we activate our strengths in order to use them for these purposes? Use the 3 C's as a framework:

1. **Clarify**: Take the time to learn what your strengths are.
2. **Communicate:** Share your strengths effectively in-person conversations, on paper, and online 
3. **Capitalize:** Find opportunities that will showcase your strengths. Consider:
    * What kind of role can you take on in project groups?
    * How could you showcase your strengths in the Turing community?
    * How will your strengths help you as a member of your cohort?

We'll utilize this framework to build an understanding of your strengths today to serve as a foundation for all of your professional development at Turing.

### Section 2: Defining Your Strengths & Assessing Your Skills
It can be easier said than done to identify what our strengths are. So, to help us break them down, we can think about them about our strengths as a combination of:

* Skills
* Knowledge
* Talents

**Skills** are something you have *learned* to do well
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I can..."

**Knowledge** is something you know or have expertise in from years of study and practice
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I know..."

**Talent** refers to something that you have a *natural ability* to do well. Another way to think about it is something you were born with and have a natural preference towards.
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I am..."

Seems easy enough, right?

Again, breaking down our strengths can be difficult, so let's start with looking at some examples.

#### Example #1
You heard from our executive director, Jeff Casimir, at the State of Turing talk. Often when people hear him speak, they remark on how passionate he is. Why is that? Let's break it down:

* Here his **skill** relates to his *public speaking* abilities. Jeff has honed those over the years in conference talks, on panels, in podcasts, and in speaking with students and stakeholders throughout the years at Turing.

* His **knowledge** can often be summed up by his "big ideas" (his words). He is a prolific reader, especially around topics of organizational leadership and best practices for schools and organizations interested in social change. He creates connections between these ideas in his blog posts and speeches.

* Now that brings us to his **talent,** which in this context relates to his ability to *engage and connect with others*. He's a connector and educator.

* Combining these 3 things leads us to the **strength** known as **Inspirational Leadership,** which is defined as the ability to uplift, enliven, fill, and empower people with a compelling vision. As the founder of several programs, Jeff has cultivated and used this strength to not only further his vision but get others involved in executing it as well.

#### Example #2
Let's look at another strength. A common strength that comes up for students in the Pairin assessment is **Persistence,** which is defined as the drive to firmly continue in a course of action, despite difficulties, opposition, or warning; stubborn determination. Pairin loves to nickname its strengths with fun names, and its reports refer to this one as "Tugboat." What does it look like in practice to be a tugboat?

* A **skill** that would contribute to this is *detail-oriented planning.* If you're someone who uses a planner, likes to write to-do lists, and approaches projects from a backwards planning stance, this might describe you!

* The **knowledge** needed here would be around knowing *how to prioritize,* which comes down to the ability to know which task to focus on at a time based on practice.

* The natural **talent** that might come into play here is the ability to *maintain focus* during arduous tasks.

Put together, these create the strength of persistence.

#### Additional Strategies
Breaking down strengths in this way can be easier when we already know what the strength is, but how can you approach identifying your strengths on your own?

1. Use the SIGN method:

  * **Success:** Using your strengths makes you feel successful
  * **Instinct:** Activities you are naturally drawn to
  * **Growth:** Where you learn the most, come up with new ideas, and have the best insights
  * **Needs:** Where you feel the need to spend the most time

2. Use others to find your strengths:

  * What do others ask for your help with?
  * What do others want you to teach them?
  * What do you receive compliments for?

### Section 3: Using the Pairin Survey
If you're having trouble identifying your strengths, your Pairin survey results might be able to help you. Pairin is a tool that gives you insight into 102 **coachable** and **changeable** professional skills ranging from citizenship to empathy to self awareness. The results from your survey will help you to identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth.

Your results show you top 4 qualities:

1. Top Thinking Style
2. Most Intense Driver
3. Highest EQ Competency
4. Leading Virtue Class

Check out the [Pairin Qualities Overview](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Pairin%20Top%20Qualities%20Overview.pdf) for additional information on each type of quality. 

If you would like more information on your Pairin results, you can reach out to Allison (@allison_reu_singer on Slack) through [this request form](https://forms.gle/1NgEeYNX7p6jYA6G9) to schedule a coaching session this module. All coaching sessions are completely confidential.

What is professional coaching? Sometimes referred to as "career therapy," coaching provides you with the opportunity for thought partnership on goals that you have for your career. What topics could be covered? Whatever you want! Some popular topics are:

* Stress management
* Organization and time management
* Career transition guidance
* Using your Pairin data for growth

## Check for Understanding (10-15 mins) 
1. Read through your Pairin Top 4 results <a name="cfu"></a>
    * Note: you submitted this PDF as part of your Mod 1 prework, but you can find it again by logging into [Pairin](https://auth.pairin.com/auth/signin?continue=https://app.pairin.com)
    * Use this [Pairin Overview handout](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Pairin%20Top%20Qualities%20Overview.pdf) to learn more about the specific qualities.

2. Complete this [reflection sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzBCsssa_V1Sx4gT8WllaUgoCjWqLcAUWiQoELdgcy4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Application
1. On Wednesday, you'll have your first [Homeroom Group](/student_discussion_groups/mod1_homeroom_discussion_prompts) discussion. Please be prepared to discuss your reflections from the lesson today. 

2. On Friday, you'll see a Slack message in your cohort channel asking you this question:
  
    * After reflecting on your strengths this week, practice replying to this interview question: *how do you see yourself using your strengths as a developer?* Keep in mind: this is not an easy question to answer on the first try! It’s ok if you feel a little shaky in your response, but the point is to practice. This is how you get better!
