### Week 2 Prompts & Structure (30 mins) <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Your activity for the week is to [work on networking](/module_one/week_2_networking_activity). Discuss your progress on the activity (25 mins):

* Have you had your networking call for this week yet? 
* If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways? 
* If you haven’t had the call yet, when are you planning to set it up? Could you use support from this group to send the message to your contact?
* How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while you’re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?  

### Week 4 Prompts & Structure (30 mins) <a name="week-4"></a>
1. Take 10 minutes to work on your [networking tracker from this week’s activity](/module_one/week_4_networking_activity)
2. Share (10 mins):
  * What have you learned so far about your current network?
  * Have you communicated with people you know about your new career in software development? How did you let them know?
  * Networking is just another word for building relationships. What are all the ways you’re currently building relationships at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support while at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support in your job search? 
3. Prep for Mix It Up groups by sharing (5 mins):
  * What group are you in today?
  * What would you like to learn today? 
  * How will you contribute to the conversation?
4. Take a 5-min pom and then join the zoom link in your Slack group for your Mix It Up group!
