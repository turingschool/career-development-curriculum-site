### [This Week's Journal Prompts](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_two/mod2_career_journal_prompts.md#week-3)
* Reflect on your habits
* Reflect on Turing experience: engagement and energy
* Setting up schedule and routines for the job search this module
* Apply wayfinding to job search tools

### Review: Professional Storytelling
Reminder that last week we discussed the principles of professional storytelling, starting with this template:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Your professional story is how you begin to communicate your career vision and help understand your character and motivations. This is how people connect with you. Make sure to continue practicing your story to get more and more comfortable with it!

### Job Search Strategies: Start with your Vision
Why does your vision matter? Remember, it's your compass! Successful job search strategies connect the dots between:
* Who you are
* What you value
* Jobs you seek out

How can you do that?
* Align your job search strategy with your vision
* Only seek out opportunities related to your vision and your industry interests

Bottom line: if something doesn't align with your vision, don't pursue it. It will not be a good use of your time.

### Wayfinding
Ideas here come from [Designing Your Life](https://bookshop.org/books/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life/9781101875322)

Wayfinding refers to the ancient practice of figuring out where you're going when you don't actually know your destination. In order to execute wayfinding, you need a compass and a general direction. That's it! There's no need to have an exact destination because when it comes to your life, there is no *one* destination; there are only clues that can allow you to figure out the best next step. The first clues you should start with are:

* Engagement
* Energy

Your journal this week asks you to [reflect on the experiences you've had at Turing so far that either sparked your engagement and energy or drained it](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_two/mod2_career_journal_prompts.md#week-3). Reflecting on these experiences will help you understand where you should focus your time in your future career.

Takeaway:
* Initial, dysfunctional belief: "Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that's why they call it work."
* Reframe: "Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you." 

So, when is work fun? Don't focus on money, perks, or "fun work culture." Instead, pay attention to when your work allows you to use your strengths or when you feel deeply engaged and energized by what you're doing -- this is the kind of work you should be pursuing. 

Come back to these ideas whenever you find yourself veering off course. Using your engagement and energy as guideposts will help you stack on track. 

### Job Search Strategies: Use Your Resources
Here are some general best practices to keep in mind when setting up your job search strategy:

1. Set up routines and a schedule
2. Set up a tracker and use it
3. Go through all the different [resources here for finding job opportunities](/resources/finding_opportunities) AND apply wayfinding:
    * Does the resource fit with the direction you want to go? If not, skip it.
    
#### Set up Routines & a Schedule
Knowing a general direction means nothing if you're going to put in the work to set out on it. You are extremely busy at Turing, but it's important that you begin to carve out time for your job search starting *right now.* How can you do this?

* Take advantage of your work time. You have PD work time set aside every week -- make sure to use it to work on your career journal, refining your career vision and job search strategy, and taking the necessary steps to further your goals.
* Reframe your approach to the time you have. Your schedule will never suddenly became free and clear, but it can become manageable if you organize it according to your priorities

It's important to recognize that if you want a job by graduation or soon after, you have to start implementing your job search routines *right now.* Here is an approach you can take:

* Block out 1-2 hours a week to work on your job search
* Again, utilize your PD work time
* What could you do during that time?
   * Conduct research into companies/job postings
   * Outreach to contacts
   * Attend networking events
   * Update your resume/write cover letters (we’ll discuss next week)
   * Update LinkedIn/GitHub/other social media
   * Practice interview prep

#### Create a Job Search Tracker: Introducing Huntr
Huntr is a kanban board-like tracker similar to Trello that allows you to track your job search in a very visual and step-by-step way. You should have received an email invitation for using it.

Within Huntr, you can create cards for a company you're interested in and then move it through each stage of the application job search. Check out this [user's guide](https://blog.huntr.co/huntr-quickstart-guide/) to get started. It's also a good idea to install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf) to seamlessly add job postings from the site you find them right to your Huntr board. 

#### Resources for Finding Opportunities: Go Beyond Job Postings
The resources listed here are not just about finding postings on job boards. In fact, your job search should *never* be limited to job postings. We'll continue to talk about the importance of building relationships and research, but it's important to note that as little as [20-30% of job listings are posted online](https://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking) and [referral candidates are 4 times as likely to be hired as non-referral candidates](https://medium.com/@mikestafiej/employee-referral-statistics-you-need-to-know-for-2020-infographic-19cc720380f2).

With that in mind, here is what the job search process should look like:

As you look for opportunities, remember to go beyond the initial posting. [Go through the resources](/resources/finding_opportunities) listed here and apply wayfinding:

* What can you pull out from job postings, company information, culture information, etc. that is aligned with your compass? If there isn’t anything, stop using it and don’t pursue that job -- it will be a waste of your time
   
### Session Takeaways
* Job search strategies should be guided by and aligned with your industry interests and overall vision
* Start your journey by diving into research to make sure everything’s aligned
* Your application process must include outreach and networking
