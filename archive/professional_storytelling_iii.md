### Professional Development in Module Three

Module Three is the module in which the personal and professional development of the previous two modules is applied to job searching and discovering the right path for your new career. You'll leave Module Three with a clear blueprint for your job search, and we'll start by focusing in on what it is that you want out of your new career, building on your professional story, and reflecting on how your strengths apply to finding this new, fulfilling career path.

We'll focus on:

* Storytelling
* Resumes
* Turing Portfolios
* Cover Letters
* Analysis of your skillset
* Job & Company Research
* Job Shadowing
* Interview skills

Some resources for you:

* Join #job-hunt
* [Interview Prep Resources](interview_prep_resources)
* [Job Search Care Package](/module-5/job_search_care_package)

**Slide #4:**

Be aware of your job search timeline:

* Do you need a job by graduation?
   * Then: You must start your search **now**
* Do you need a job by 30 days after graduation?
   * Then: You must start your search by the end of this module
* Do you have a longer timeline?
   * Then: Use this module to begin research

**Slide #6:**

### Objectives

* Build on your professional story by focusing on "what's next"
* Create a resume and Turing portfolio that reflect your skills and your professional story

### Deliverables

* Draft of your resume due by 5pm Monday of Week 2
* Draft of your [Turing alumni portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io) by 9am Thursday of Week 2
* Mock behavioral interview & resume review with a member of the Career Development Team in Weeks 3 and 4
* Final draft of Turing alumni portfolio by 9am Monday of Week 6

Using slides #7-10, go through the following:

**Slide #7:**

### Opening: Housekeeping

#### Mock Interviews

* Using the sign-up sheet in your channel, select 1 20-min mock interview slot when you don't have class
* Write this appointment down in your calendar
* Use the doc you’ve been working on in your pre-work for Mod 3 to prep
* You should bring questions to practice asking
   * Tailor them to a specific company if you have one in mind!

**Slides #8-10:**

#### Job Shadow

What is it?

 * A chance to learn from and observe developers on the job.
 * An opportunity to ask questions of HR and developers about success in the job hunt.
 * A time to make some initial networking connections and possibly find a mentor.
 * A professional event where you are acting as a representative of Turing.

What it's not:

 * Time to work on your own projects or studies (though you can ask for advice).
 * Time to review the tech stack you have been learning (though this might happen, it is not likely).
 * A job interview.
 * A "free" afternoon.
 * A social event

How can you earn job shadow?

* By completing a first draft of your Turing alumni portfolio.

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #11-13 and showing students the [alumni portfolio site](https://alumni.turing.io) and video for how to fill it out (link below), go through the following:

**Slide #11:**

#### Turing Alumni Portfolio

* You should have an invite to create your Turing alumni portfolio in your email. To log in again, go to [https://alumni.turing.io/user](https://alumni.turing.io/user)

Here are the must haves:
* Professional photo
* Description -- use this space to tell your professional story!
* Draft of your resume *after you've received feedback and updated it using [CV Compiler](https://cvcompiler.com/students/turingschool)*
  * FINAL DRAFT: must have final resume
* 2 projects highlighted
  * Show variety: paired, team, individual
  * FINAL DRAFT: must have 3 projects
* Select “published” for both your profile and projects when you save them

Check out some examples of how others have created their [portfolios](https://alumni.turing.io).

**Slides #12-13:**

This site is very buggy. To make sure you can save your profile, follow these steps:
* Use Safari
* Double check these fields when trying to save:
 * Name
 * Your expertise
 * Professional headshot (choose file, then click upload)
 * Put a placeholder in the summary but when writing it out, don't copy and paste as it won't paste correctly.
* Select any cohort; that doesn't matter
* GitHub ID doesn't matter; leave it blank
* Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7J5cYJ24hU&feature=youtu.be) to see how to fill this out

**Facilitator #1:** Using slide #15 and a timer app, go through the following:

### Storytelling Review

Last module, you created a draft of your professional story. Today we'll talk about how you can refine your professional story through tools like your resume and your Turing alumni portfolio. But first, practice makes perfect:

* Spend 2 minutes reviewing your story gist
* Pair & Share #1: Practice your story as though you are at a networking event and someone says "tell me about yourself." You and your partner each get 1 minute to share your story.
* Pair & Share #2: Practice your story as though an employer has just asked you "Why should I hire you?" You and your partner each get 1 minute to share your story.

Whole Group Debrief:
* On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to practice your story?
* How did telling your story change depending on the context?
* What kinds of details did you remember from your partner's story?

As we dive into your resumes and portfolios today, we're going to aim to address both of those statements--"tell me about yourself" and "why should I hire you?"--through the details you include.

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #17-20, go through the following:

**Slide #17:**

### How can you tell your story? Resumes!

**Whole Group Discussion:**
Cold call on 2-3 people to answer this question: *as a new software developer, what kind of story do you want your resume to tell about you?*

**Slide #18:**

**Activity: Who do you interview?**

Form groups of 3-4 people. You are now on a hiring committee for a junior engineering position at your company. You need to select 1 out of the 5 resumes listed here to decide who will move on to an interview.

**Note to Facilitator #2:** Make sure students have the markdown open on their computers for this activity

Things to consider:
* For the sake of this activity, the position is language agnostic
* All of these resumes are from Turing alumni. As a soon-to-be alum, you should consider how you can use your resume to stand out amongst others with similar skillsets

**Slide #19:**

Discussion Questions:
* What is your first impression of this candidate?
* What do you know about this candidate's technical abilities?
* What questions do you have about this candidate?
* Would you choose to interview this person? Why or why not?
* If you decide to interview them, what follow-up questions would you ask?

**Slide #20:**

Whole Group Debrief:
* Who was chosen to move to an interview? Why?
* What are your takeaways about effective resumes?

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #22-32, go through the following:

### Rebuilding Your Resume: Format & Content

As a junior developer, your resume might look very different from its previous forms. Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and coding projects
* Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role
* Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards

#### Content Inclusion - Follow this order

Use this [checklist when creating your resume](resume_review_checklist)

* **Header:**
	* Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)
	* Remove location
	* Include title (Software Developer)

* **Summary:** Summary should be 3-4 sentences about your journey into software developer. Tell the reader:
	* Who you are: As a software developer? Team member? Career changer? Individual?
	* How you got here: Why software development? Why Turing? Why now?
	* What’s Next: What do you hope to accomplish? What are you looking to gain from this experience? Is there a particular industry/tech stack/project you would like to be working with?

* **Skills:** Continue to add to this area outlining your technical specialties (languages, frameworks, testing and tools). Ideally you want 12-20 items by the end of the program.
	* Highlight your dev/technical skills here. Include any transferable and/or professional skills in the experience section (see below).

* **Projects:** Follow skills with a project section that includes 2-3 of your favorite projects. What are you proud of? Show it off! Provide a 1-2 sentence overview of the project. Consider answering these questions:
	* What does your application do? What problem does it solve?
	* Who is it built for? What does it allow the user to do?
	* What technologies did you use? Dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.
	* In what period of time was it built? This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
	* If you worked in a group, what was your role in the project?

* Include both a clickable link to your project repo and to the launched application. The repo should include a ReadMe. If the project lives on a partner's GitHub, make sure to clone down your own version and include that link instead.

* **Experience:** Follow Projects with Experience
	* Title as "Experience" rather than "Employment"
	* Format should start with title followed by company
	* Use dates
	* Use bullet points (3-5 per organization) & focus on the value that you brought to the organization rather than the individual tasks performed. This is a perfect place to discuss other skills you have that you've utilized in adding value to the company. Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, *What were your boring day-to-day duties?*
	* Turing can fall under experience or education but having it fall under experience brings it closer to the top and ties in with your self identification as a software developer. *Titling this category as “experience” rather than work history/employment allows for it to include things aside from paid employment*

* Education
	* Remove dates. List in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent
	* Remove GPAs

As you update your resume, check on what updates you need to make to your LinkedIn -- update this profile as often as necessary to ensure it reflects exactly what you want it to portray.

#### Layouts

#### What Not to Include

* Headshots
* Special interests (hobbies, etc.)
* Sliding scale of skills
    * Instead, label new skills as “learning” or “interested in”
* Colors that are not printer-friendly
     * Or make sure to have a printer-friendly version
* Your own coded resume
