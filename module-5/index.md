### Job Search Coaching: What you can expect from us

Career development and job search support is included in Turing tuition, but beyond that, we do not fulfill our mission without supporting every graduate to find a fulfilling technical job. This means that we will not only provide you with ongoing customized support but we will also refer you to positions that are aligned with your interests and skills. 

### You'll work with Lex Stewart (@lex on Slack), the Career Specialist overseeing New Graduate Services. 

## Job Seeker Expectations: What we expect from you
We are going to provide as much support as you need, but this is a partnership with every job seeker -- you are expected to participate in this mentorship until you secure your first technical job.

What does this mean? 
* Attend small group meetings and/or setting up 1:1 coaching session with your Career Specialist
* Respond to messages from your Career Specialist in a timely manner
* Engage with feedback from your Career Specialist and other job seekers
* Complete surveys and deliverables established in the New Graduate Services Slack Channel, small group, or larger group sessions
* Follow up on agreed upon action steps with your Career Specialist
* Communicate any challenges or other circumstances that are affecting your job search

It's important for us to know what's going on with you in regards to your job search, and regular communication will be key. We can't help you if we don't hear from you! 

## Group Coaching: What it looks like
Each week, you'll have the opportunity to participate in a variety of group activities. The most up-to-date information will be posted in the #module-5 channel on Slack, but here are some potential topics of discussion:

* Networking strategies
* Resume or cover letter review workshops
* Interview strategies
* Dealing with rejection
* Time management & scheduling
* Group working sessions to build accountability
