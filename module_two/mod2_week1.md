#### Section 1: Contact Information, Title and Headline

Your desired job title is one of the most essential keywords in applicant tracking systems when screening resumes.

#### Section 2: Resume Summary (optional)
The Summary section is optional; however, it can be strategically used as a career changer to connect the dots for an employer to explain career change and the value you will bring to the Company and role.

If you’re considering a summary statement: 
* Think about what relevant and novel information you can provide the employer.
* Which transferable skills matter to this role? 
* What's your zone of genius? Where do you gain energy in your work? What impact do you want to have in this role/company?


#### Section 3: Skills and Keywords

A good rule of thumb is to only include the technical skills you’re comfortable talking about in an interview.

#### Section 4: Technical Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are essential -- arguably, the **most** vital -- part of your new resume.

Project overviews should also include accomplishments, outcomes, and results:
* What was your role in the project? 
* What specific goals did you meet?  
* What was the result/impact of your project/work? 

#### Section 5: Work Experience

* Think of your bullet points as Storytelling -Short, accomplishment stories.
* Quantify impact with a #, % or $ amount whenever possible. I did X and the result was Y; state the result or outcome. 

#### Section 6: Education and Training
Creating an “Education and Training” section will help showcase your developer training and highlight your transferable qualifications.

### Next Steps:

* Complete this [exit ticket](https://forms.gle/rSWwn2QFQL3ZsDhr7). **Completion of this exit ticket is required for your professional development this module.** 

* Create a resume first draft with these steps to get started:

* First, plan the framework of your resume based on the lesson:
    * Will you use a resume summary? 
    * What relevant work experience will be used?
    * Which prior education and training will be added?
    * Which industry-specific skills are most important right now to add?
  
* Next, choose a resume template: 
    * Pick an ATS-friendly template with [Job Scan Template](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-templates). These               templates will download as Word docs. You can either cut and paste it or upload it to Google Docs.
    * We recommend that you review this [ATS Friendly Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ylVW3d_uHjAwSGkK4WJlbJuU_22BPSK75dn2rRDnm-g/edit?usp=sharing)
    
* Then, develop a rough draft of your resume:
     * Use [this resume checklist](https://careerdev.turing.edu/resources/resume_resources) to guide your draft development. 
     * Include technical projects on your resume. Consider some of the projects you've completed so far in the program to help you construct your    bulleted descriptions (you can switch them out later for other projects, but you should become comfortable with describing them concisely). 
   
 * When describing projects, consider the following:
     * Name of the project (group/solo/pair)- URL (hyperlinked)
     * Time spent on the project (hours, days, or weeks)
     * Describe the project briefly. What does it do? 
     * Bullet points should include action verbs, tasks, and results:
         * Describe one aspect of how the project was built.
         * Share another example of how the project was created.
         * Describe the method, process, or workflow.
         * In groups, how did you contribute?
         * Describe the technology stack you used.
        
 * Resources
   * Use this to organize your resume content [resume worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1870HMMJQfTDzRLR-xzee2YGAX1GW5KwSp73mtFsF_Do/edit)
   * Consider building your resume content from your LinkedIn profile summary with the [LinkedIn Resume Builder](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/94034/linkedin-resume-builder?lang=en). Once downloaded, cut and          paste the summary into an ATS-friendly resume template.
