title: Module 2 Week 4
---

## Overview
This week, instead of a session, you have a live event called **What's a Dev.** What's a Dev is an event that brings together developers from Turing employer partners to meet with students.

We started this event to help Mod 2 students gain an understanding of what a developer actually does. The Whatâ€™s A Dev experience provides you with the opportunity to understand the culture of a tech company, experience a glimpse into a day in the life of a developer, and gain exposure to the amazing work that companies are doing on a daily basis. 

## What's a Dev Event
### How to Prepare
A member of the Career Dev team will post information on the companies and contacts who will be attending in your cohort channel by Monday of week 4. You will also be put into a Slack channel for your breakout small group "shadow." You can ask any follow-up questions in that channel. 

Spend some time before the event researching the company website and your contact on LinkedIn. Think of 1-3 questions that you want to ask, both in the panel discusison and in your small group. 

During the breakout discussion, your SLC rep in the group will help monitor the chat and make sure everyone stays on schedule. 

Note: depending on the company, you may be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to meeting with them. 

### Logistics
* 1:00-1:45pm: A panel of 3 employers will speak to your cohort about their company (culture, hiring practices, what makes them unique) while one of your instructors moderates. You'll join the zoom link that was shared for the whole group.
* 1:45-1:55pm: Pomodoro Break. Leave the first zoom call and join the zoom link posted in your breakout group channel at 1:55pm. 
* 1:55-2:25pm: Hear about a day in the life of a developer from your contact
* 2:25-3:15pm: Watch your contact go through some code or a tech challenge in order to see how they would solve problems in real time
* 3:15-3:45pm: Discussion of advice and guidance in the tech industry. You can ask more specific questions and make sure to share contact information to follow up.
