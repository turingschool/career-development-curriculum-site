title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 2
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

During your time in Mod 2 PD, we focused on building these core competencies:

* Continue building community through professional development
* Gain clarity on personal career goals
* Continue utilizing mentor for job search support
* Customize strategies for job search

By the end of Module 2, we aim for students to achieve [Levels I and II readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Job Search Strategies and Negotiations and achieve [Level II readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Interviewing, and Materials. While you repeat the module, this is an opportunity to continue this work and think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

## Expectations for Repeating the Module

### Sessions
During the 2105 inning, you are required to Week 1's session [Introduction to Your Career Roadmap](/module_two/week_1_career_roadmap), but you are **not** required to attend the rest of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the weekly sessions:

* Week 2: [Building Connection: Part I](/module_two/week_2_building_connection_i)
* Week 3: [Interview Prep](/module_two/week_3_interview_prep)
* Week 4: [Your Career Roadmap Part II](/module_two/week_4_career_roadmap_ii)

### Homeroom Groups
You will be added to a new homeroom group with your new cohort. This is an opportunity to build new networking relationships, support each other with professional development and the job search, and connect with each other. 

During homeroom group time, some of the discussion topics will pertain to the session for that week. Even though you do not have to attend the sessions, you should contribute your ideas and reflections to the group and use the space to solicit feedback and collaboration on what you're working on. 

Reminder on [Homeroom Group expectations](/student_discussion_groups/).

### What You'll Work On
For this module, you should create 2 [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What should these goals look like?

#### Template for Defining & Tracking Your Goals
Use this template to help you define and track your goals by copying and pasting the questions below into a document you can share with Allison or your homeroom group. 

* Specific (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?): 

* Measurable (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?):

* Achievable (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?):

* Relevant (How does this goal connect to your larger career goals?):

* Timebound (When do you plan to achieve this goal by? Be specific and consider how realistic your expectations are):
