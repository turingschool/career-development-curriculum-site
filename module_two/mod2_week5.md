## Resume Review Workshop
### Overview
This workshop takes place during Week 5 Homeroom.

1. Revisit your norms as a group to understand how you'll approach feedback with each other in this space (5 mins)
2. Status check (10 mins)
   * What do you feel good about with your resume? 
   * What questions do you still have about making your resume effective? 
   * What do you want to have completed by the end of today's working session?
3. Spend 20 minutes updating your your ATS-ready resume draft:
   * If you received specific feedback from the Career Dev team on how to improve it, start there.
   * Consider updating or adding in new projects to your draft.
   * If your ATS version of your resume is updated and ready to re-submit for PD, you could start on a "pretty" version using some of the templates and resources [here](/resources/resume_resources). 
5. Use the remaining 20-30 minutes for feedback. Each person gets a chance to share their resume draft, and each person should provide feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind.

### Reminders
* **Update your resume draft** using the feedback you got today.
* **Continue building your job search strategy** using the [resources from Week 3](/module_two/mod2_week3). 
* **Complete 1 networking activity** from [Week 2's lesson](/module_two/mod2_week2)
