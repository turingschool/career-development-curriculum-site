title: Module 2 Professional Development
---

## Overview
Our approach to Mod 2 is to build on the competencies covered in Mod 1 so that students can begin to create a job search and branding strategy as well as learn more about what software development looks like so that they can more clearly define their goals. Mod 2 professional development is delivered through a combination of self-paced asynchronous sessions, small group discussion, office hours, and other check-ins. 

### Key Learning Goals
The following are covered in the Mod 2 curriculum from our 5 core competencies:

* **Networking:**
    * Build on and create new networking strategies to expand your network
    * Utilize networking to conduct research for your new career
* **Interviewing:**
    * Build self-awareness around your background, strengths, values, and goals in order to describe them to others
* **Materials:**
    * Utilize your understanding of your story and your experiences to creatae a resume draft
* **Job Search Strategies:**
    * Combine your values and goals along with tools we'll provide you to create a strong job search strategy

See more about these learning goals [here](/module_two/mod2_learning_goals).
