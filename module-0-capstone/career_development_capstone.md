# Turing Career Development - Mod 0 Capstone
## Developing Mindsets to Succeed

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

When you're transitioning careers, often many other aspects of your approach to work and life undergo a transition as well. Turing aims to be a place where you can work through these transitions successfully. While enrolled at Turing and during your subsequent job search, you'll be provided with tools and strategies to develop the professional skills necessary to enter a new career as a software developer.

The career development capstone is focused on introducing you to a set of mindsets that we at Turing believe will make you a successful programmer. These mindsets are:

* Agency: Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* Empathy: Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them
* Engagement: Active participation in community
* Grit: A combination of perseverance and passion
* Growth: A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

### Introduction to Strengths-based Development
One tool we'll be using for your professional development at Turing is the [Pairin Survey](https://www.pairin.com/). This survey measures over 100 coachable and changeable skills. This activity invites you to begin building an understanding of how learning about and developing your strengths applies to your success in your new career. We will discuss the results of this survey more in-depth in your first professional development session at Turing. 

We will also be asking you to create and use a career journal during your time at Turing to practice the skill of self-reflection and track the progress that you're making in your career change and new job search. 

## **Capstone submission directions:**
### Part One: Pairin Survey
1. Take the survey using [this link](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/15960/student). It will prompt you to create an account when you take it. There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes.
  
2. Create a gist to include a screenshot of your Pairin top 4 results by following [these directions](https://gist.github.com/kannankumar/4c613cac6d9db896062a16e1cc57d3e5)
