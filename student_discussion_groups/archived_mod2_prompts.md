### Week 2 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
  * What was helpful last mod?
  * What do you want to keep doing?
  * What do you want to stop doing?
  * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. Go to [terminal.turing.edu](https://terminal.turing.edu) and find three peer profiles to review. Find their resume by clicking on "open resume" on the left side of the portfolio. Take 10 minutes to examine these resumes and ask yourself these questions (be sure to take some notes on your career roadmap):

* What do I like about this resume?
* What stands out the most?
* What would I do differently on this resume?

3. Share out what you found (10-15 mins):
* Is there anything you found that you will be doing on your resume?
* Based on what you saw, how are you going to highlight projects on your resume? What about your past experience?
* What are your plans to make your resume unique to you?

4. Start working on your own resume draft. You can review tips from the [session](/module_two/week_1_career_roadmap) and check out these [resources](/resources/resume_resources) to help you. (15 mins)

5. Share out what you've completed so far with the rest of your group and discuss next steps to help each other complete your resume drafts over the next few weeks (5 mins).

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins) 
2. Your session this week is on interviewing, so let’s talk about interview prep and skills! Each person share (10 mins):
  * In previous interviews, what have you done well?
  * In previous interviews, what has been challenging for you?
  * What are your biggest concerns regarding interviews in the software industry? Write down some of these to discuss in tomorrow’s session
3. [Spend 10 minutes reading through and bookmarking some of the resources here](/resources/interview_prep_resources) (10 mins):
4. Discuss (15 mins):
  * What resource did you look at? What is helpful about it?
  * Technical interviews have a lot of similarities to assessments and evaluations you complete at Turing. Think back to your most recent assessment. What did you do well when it came to talking through your thought process? What do you want to improve on in this area? How could this group support you with that?
  * When you don’t know how to answer a technical question in an interview, what can you do?
  * What do you think are the 3 most important things an employer would want to know about a Turing graduate? How should you make sure to communicate that in an interview?
5. In your career journal gist (or anywhere you will remember to look at this again), write down all the projects you’ve worked on so far (10 mins). 
  * Write 1 sentence describing the objective of the project
  * Write down 3 high points of the project (did you successfully incorporate a new piece of learning? When did you/your team persevere through a challenge? What are you proud of with this project?)
  * Write down 3 challenges you encountered in the project (what mistakes did you make? What did you learn from those experiences?)
6. Close out the discussion (10 mins):
  * Share what you wrote about with your projects
  * Revisit the concerns you wrote down at the beginning of the discussion today. Did you gain clarity on any of them? What are you still concerned about?
