title: Mod 3 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 3, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
   
   * What was helpful last mod?
   * What do you want to keep doing?
   * What do you want to stop doing?
   * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. Review your [career roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yMlss8updK2zaTVPwUzcoBG2ws5zBWENjE2a-SjSPeM/edit?usp=sharing) and take 10 mins to update it.

3. As a group discuss (10-15 mins):
  
   * Based on what you filled out in the roadmap so far, what kinds of industries/jobs will you be targeting? What do you already know about those industries? What do you still want to learn?
   * How could you use your resume to show that these are the jobs you’re both qualified for and seeking?  
   * What questions or concerns do you have about building your resume? 

4. Research time (10 mins):
   
   * Using these [resources](/resources/finding_opportunities) + your roadmap, find a job you would like to apply to.

5. Share what you found and discuss why it’s a good fit for you (10 mins):
  
   * Why are you interested in this job? 
   * What else do you need to learn to know if it’s a good job for you to apply to?
     * Examples: learn about the company’s culture 
     * The best way to do that is through networking; how will you approach networking for this position?
   * Identify one next step you will take for this job:
     * Add this job to Huntr
     * Reach out to someone at the company
     * Update your resume for this position

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Discuss (20 mins):
  * What are some ways that you have been networking currently? 
  * What parts of your personal network have you not yet explored? 
  * What are your networking goals for the remainder of this inning? 
3. Take one of the networking goals you mentioned and create an action plan (15 mins):
  * Decide on 1 person to reach out to from a company you are interested in.
  * Use the 3rd tab on [this tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing) to track information on the details for outreach 
  * Draft a message to send. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LeI2exD3jqzdgz5eFs6PLyaSspLCWvnds9VoxVbCFeQ/edit?usp=sharing) of outreach message templates to help you and use the [resources here for finding email addresses](/resources/outreach_networking_resources). You can also consider using LinkedIn or reaching out over Twitter.  
4. Share with your group (10 mins):
  * Who are you reaching out to and why?
  * What are you going to talk about in your message?
  * What questions do you want to ask when you talk to this person?
  * What help could you use from the group to hold you accountable to following through with this outreach?
5. Get final feedback on the messages and send them! (5 mins)
 
### Week 5 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-5"></a>
Today's homeroom is a cover letter feedback workshop with your group. Please bring a cover letter that you're working on to the group. 

1. Revisit norms (5 mins) 

2. Take turns sharing your cover letters with each other. When possible, share the job posting and provide context about the position and company. All group members should provide appreciation and coaching feedback. What is effective about this cover letter? What could make this cover letter more effective? Reminder about best practices for [cover letters from the session](/module_three/week_3_application_process_session) and from [this resource guide](/resources/cover_letter_resources). (40 mins)

3. Assess the feedback you received and make a plan for revision (15 mins):

  * What feedback did your partner give you?
  * What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?
  * If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? 
  * What other next steps would you need to take for this application?
