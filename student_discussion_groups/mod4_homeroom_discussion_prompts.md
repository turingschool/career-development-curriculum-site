title: Student Houses Guidelines & Prompts for Module 4
---

### Guidelines
1. Each house member should actively participate in the time allotted for professional development. 
2. Communicating your inability to attend is a best practice similar to any workplace. 
3. Consider house time during Mod 4 as a collaborative workspace.

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
First, Start with introductions (or a check in) and each person shares something fun about themselves. 5-6 minutes.
  * Review the Prompt and decide who will keep the time or how it can be done. 
  * Based on PD focus, decide whether breakout rooms will be used in pairs or smaller groups. 5 minutes.
  * Discuss or revisit group norms if needed. These could include:
	  How does your group communicate and provide feedback?
     Holding each other accountable
     How and if you will communicate outside of Wednesday group meetings? 
 
2. Next, Start Job Search Activity
  * An excellent way to start and or continue a successful job search is by getting clear on your target audience by narrowing your search. 
  * Here is a worksheet to help you identify your Job Search Targets. If it makes sense for the stage of your job search, make a copy and start researching. (COMING SOON).
  * Feel free to move on to the next activity if you have completed a similar job search reflection and have narrowed your job search.
  *  Getting started with a Proactive Job Search (COMING SOON).

3. Wrap up: 10 minutes
 * Each person shares one takeaway: a question, a need for support, or an action item you will complete by the next House meeting in week 3. 
 (s).
 * If you are short on time, decide if posting a thread in your house channel is a good way to hold each other accountable and celebrate your good work today!
