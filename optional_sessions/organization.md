### Opening
Staying organized at Turing can be challenging for even the most put-together person. Between deadlines, constant messages, and various priorities, there's a lot to juggle. This session is focused on providing you with tools to manage various aspects of organization more successfully.

Objectives of this session:
* Assess how you're doing in certain areas of organization
* Explore tools to help with managing deadlines, notifications, and workflow
* Commit to action steps to improve your organizational skills

Relating back to the mission: *Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.* In this session, we're focused on this "unlocking human potential" piece because we can all become better organized by incorporating some intentional strategies!

### Self-Assessment
Take this [self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zz8z01As0hvmPDRFfYtkw6tLrQwDOAdu5K4cRkuwZ1o/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on your current organizational practices. Use the following rating to assess your answers:

| Number Score | Meaning      |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1            | Never        |
| 2            | Occasionally |
| 3            | Sometimes    |
| 4            | Often        |
| 5            | Always       |

1. I am able to meet deadlines easily.
2. I tend to finish my projects at the last minute.
3. I come to classes prepared.
4. I put off responding to Slack or email messages.
5. I like to make a plan for my worktime before I sit down to start.
6. I tend to organize my notes, resources, and online bookmarks into specific files.
7. I have a cluttered workspace.
8. I know how to prioritize the tasks I need to do and set specific goals for myself to complete them.
9. I catch myself going down rabbit holes, surfing online, or feeling distracted in another way and can easily get myself back on track.
10. I use a project/time management tool such as a planner, calendar, checklist, etc.

### Turn & Talk
Share your concerns with organization from self-assessment with a partner. Consider these questions:
* How did you feel about your answers?
* What concerns do you have based on this assessment?
* What are some areas that you feel like you could improve in based on this assessment?

### Using Calendars, Planners, and To-Do Lists Effectively
First things first, staying organized comes down to the tools that you use. There are a wide variety of tools out there than can help you stay organized, but the most important thing is to find 1 tool that works for you.

#### Calendars
Let's start by looking at calendars. I recommend using Google Calendar because you can easily sync it with the Turing module calendars. You can create different calendars for different purposes if you'd prefer to keep your work life separate from your home life. Here are [directions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en) on how to set up separate calendars.

**Tips for using a calendar effectively:**
* Sync with other calendars to see how their events match up with your schedule. To add a Turing module or the community calendar, navigate to your program's site:
    * [backend.turing.io](backend.turing.io)
    * [frontend.turing.io](frontend.turing.io)
Find the relevant calendar and click on the plus in the bottom right of the calendar:
![Adding Google Calendar](/files/Adding%20Google%20Calendar.png)
* Add events as needed to keep track of appointments, deadlines, and to create specific timeboxes to get tasks done
* Enable notifications so that you can be reminded of pending appointments. Navigate to "My Calendars" on the lefthand side of the screen, click on the dropdown arrow, and click on "Edit Notifications." After you set the timing on notifications that will work best for you, you can also decide how you'd like to receive that notification back on the "General" screen.


#### Beyond Calendars
There are other organizational systems that could be helpful for you to stay on top of deadlines and tasks. We'll highlight a few of them here, but again, the most important thing is to find something that works for you.  

#### Going Analog
Using a physical planner can be a great way to keep track of deadlines and task lists through a system that you can design. There is also something very satisfying about writing something down and being able to check it off later.

**[Bullet Journals](http://bulletjournal.com/)** allows you to use a physical planner in a way that organizes your thoughts in a productive way.     
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) shows how it can work.
* Whole Group Discussion:
   * What are your takeaways about how the bullet journal can work?
* Summary of possible takeaways:
   * You can customize the bullet journal to what works for your brain (instead of using an app that is preloaded for one way of doing things)
   * Organize according to time and find information again:
      * Index
      * Future Log
      * Monthly Log
      * Daily Log
   * The act of reflecting on time spent: "is this worth my time?" which helps cut down on distractions
   * Make this even more effective by using a journal with blank pages so that you can include spaces for class notes, pseudo-coding, etc.

#### Virtual To-Do Lists & Task Management Apps
* **Todoist:** This site provides a way to create to-do lists complete with sub-tasks, sub-projects, and sharing and collaborating with others. You can create ways to prioritize your to-dos as well.
![Todoist](/files/Todoist.png)
* **Wunderlist:** This is a straightforward app for creating to-do lists and setting reminders. You can also collaborate with others on shared lists.
![Wunderlist](/files/Wunderlist.jpg)
* **Trello** lets you create boards that contain lists that contain cards. These boards can be shared with other Trello users. Cards have titles, descriptions, a message log for activities, checklists, due dates, labels, links, attachments and be assigned to other Trello users.

* **Workflowy:** Create to-do lists in a very straightforward way.

#### Bookmarks
As you compile notes and resources from your many classes and web searches, having a quick, reliable way to find them again is essential. **Google Keep** is a great organizer for bookmarks. Use it to keep track of notes, reminders, and to-do lists in one place that syncs with your Google accounts and that you can share with others to help hold yourself accountable. Add it as an extension on your browser on Chrome to have a handy way to organize your bookmarks quickly.

#### You Do
Make plans to set up a system right now. If you're already using a system, consider ways of making it more productive. Consider:

* What is most meaningful to you when it comes to organizing your priorities?
* What system will have the most motivation for you?

### Workflow & Time Management
As I mentioned above with these systems, they only work if we put the right effort and motivation into them. That leads to productive workflow. Some key elements to this are:

 * Timeboxing:
   * Decide how much time you can devote to a task
   * Block out that time
   * Stick to that time as though it's an appointment
 * Pre-planning:
   * Once you have a timebox set, create a plan for what you'll accomplish during that time
   * Backwards plan: what do you want to have accomplished at the end of this time?
   * Decide on benchmarks: how will you gauge progress during this time?
 * Pomodoros:
   * We cannot work tirelessly for hours on end. Our brains and bodies need breaks or our productivity will suffer.
   * Utilize a Pomodoro timer. There are a lot of these available on the internet, like [this one](https://tomato-timer.com/) or [this one](http://www.marinaratimer.com/) or [this one](http://www.online-timers.com/pomodoro-timers).

#### Small Group Discussion
Get into groups of 3-4 people to talk through these questions:

* What blockers to managing workflow have come up for you in the past?
* What are the advantages of backwards planning your work time?
* What is difficult about taking breaks?
* How might you adopt some of these ideas into your workflow?

### Managing Messages & Notifications in Slack
Slack is Turing's main mode of communication, so we expect students to be checking it regularly. However, with all the channels and notifications, how can you keep it all straight?

#### Notifications
Start by setting up your notifications. Hit ```command ,``` to open up Notifications:

![Opening Notifications](/images/Opening%20Notifications.png)

You shouldn't have these totally turned off, but you should create a system to prioritize messages.

#### Prioritizing Messages
Other things to keep in mind:
* Star channels you use frequently
* Utilize the "All Unreads" feature to quickly skim messages and see what's important for you to respond to *now* and what can wait
* Mark messages as "unread" if you need to back to them later by clicking on the ellipsis (...) button when you hover over a message and clicking "Mark unread" OR you can ask Slackbot to remind you to respond to something later by hitting ```/remind``` and then typing out a message that Slackbot can notify you about. Here are some examples:
![Slackbot Remind Feature](/files/Slackbot%20Remind%20Feature.png)

#### Other Resources
While [this tutorial](https://vimeo.com/157164958) was made in an earlier version of Slack's interface, it includes all the same information as a helpful refresher from today's session.

### Commitment to Action
Individually, decide what changes you will commit to in order to improve your organizational skills.

Reflect on these questions:

* What systems are you already using? On a scale of 1-5, how effective have they been for you at Turing?
* What is one area that you could improve on? Look back at your self-assessment from the beginning of this session.
* What steps will you take to improve in this area?
* When do you want to implement these changes?
* How will you know that you've made progress in this area?
* Is there anyone you will check in with to hold you accountable?  

### Closing
2-3 students share out their action steps
