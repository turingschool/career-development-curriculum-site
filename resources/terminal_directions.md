title: Terminal Portfolio Directions

### Your Alumni Portfolio
Turing provides a space for professional portfolios on [our website](https://terminal.turing.edu). Employers come to this part of our site to find candidates, and we also share these with employers who come to us asking for candidates. Terminal also functions as a job board -- this is where the job postings in #job-hunt come from!

#### How to Set It Up
You will receive an email invitation from the Career Dev team at the beginning of Mod 3. 

To set up your profile: 
* Log into Terminal at [https://terminal.turing.edu/developers/sign_in](https://terminal.turing.edu/developers/sign_in)
* Go to “Edit Profile” from account menu
* Fill out profile until all sections are complete
* Click “Request Review”
* Staff member will review your profile and approve for publishing or request additional changes
* For more info on how to set this up, [watch this demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqHrdkr0B5wEvEaH9Z8dJK56TcSJoV_t/view)

Once published, your profile will be visible on the main alumni directory at [terminal.turing.edu](https://terminal.turing.edu) as long as you are participating in job search support until you get your first job. While you are actively job searching, the Career Dev team will use your portfolio in referrals to companies. 

####  About Me Section
What do you want your profile to say about you? Write out a rough draft of your professional story considering using this framework:

* What is your career story about your past, present, and future that you want to share with employers? 
* What prior experiences are relevant and transferrabe to the tech industry?
* What impact you want to have in software development?
* What kind of company and culture are you passionate about adding value for?

In this section, make sure to answer the following questions:

* Who am I? 
* Why am I in this field? 
* What's next for me? 

Show readers who you are by telling a story of your journey into tech. Share enough for them to want to hear and learn more! 

Your Terminal about me section, LinkedIn summary, and resume summary (if you chose to use one) should all be slightly different. 

* First, you want the reader to learn something new with each profile
* Second, each summary has a different purpose; think about the audience
  * Resume summaries should tell why you are the best candidate for the role relevant to the job description. 
  * LinkedIn summaries allows you to add a personal touch in addition to relevant skills and experiences that will attract recruiters and hiring managers.
  * Terminal is similiar to the LinkedIn audience; employers want to know your backstory, your value proposition and what's next for you as a developer.
