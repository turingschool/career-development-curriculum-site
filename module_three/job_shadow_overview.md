title: Job Shadow Opportunity
---

## Overview
This opportunity exposes you to the culture of tech companies, experience high-functioning team interactions, and gain exposure to the amazing work that companies are doing on a daily basis. Students experience many positive things at Turing; however, there is no substitute for seeing exceptional companies in action.

### How to Prepare
By Week 3, you'll be informed of the company and point of contact you'll be shadowing with, along with details for the live session and any paperwork you need to do beforehand (most companies require an NDA).

Before the event, take time to research the company and decide on some questions you'd like answered. A good template for this is AEIOU:

* Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?
* Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
* Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?
* Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?
* Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?

### Logistics
The Job Shadow event happens on the Tuesday of Week 4 from 1-3pm MT. Typical shadowing activities include:

* Sit-in/Observe team meetings
* Sit-in/Observe developers planning and coding
* Collaborate/Pair with your developers on their work
* Culture conversation with hiring managers or HR
* Question and answer session if time and resources permit
