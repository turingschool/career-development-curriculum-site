### Facilitator Instructions
There are facilitator notes throughout this markdown to divide up responsibilities in the session, assuming there are 2 instructors (1 BE and 1 FE) in the session. Please read through this markdown ahead of the session, decide who is going to be Facilitator #1 and who will be Facilitator #2.

### Session Structure

Length: 60 minutes

**Facilitator #1:** Using slides #3-12, go through the following:

**Slide #3:**

* Opening: 5 mins
* Review & Strategy: 10 mins
* Whole Group Practice: 20 mins
* Debrief: 5 mins
* Partner Work Time: 15 mins
* Next Steps & Closing: 5 mins

**Slide #4:**

#### Objectives
* Understand the role of outreach within your job search
* Review and execute outreach strategies
* Identify how you will move forward with at least one contact for your own job search

**Slide #5:**

### Opening
Last mod, we discussed utilizing outreach for research to use in your job search by setting up meetings with warm outreach contacts. Now we'll start to discuss how to use the same outreach principles and apply them to reaching out to people at the companies with open positions that you want.

#### Turn & Talk
* Did you execute your outreach plan from last mod?
  * What were your results?
* If you didnâ€™t execute your plan, why not?
  * What held you back?

Facilitator calls on 2 groups to share out what they discussed.

**Slide #7:**

### Review
What is our strategy for job searching? When we find a position want to apply for, we also need to find someone to reach out to.

**Slide #8:**

#### The Why
Now that you're researching companies and positions, why reach out to someone from that company?

* Research
  * Incorporate into your cover letter and interviews
* Connecting with a person
  * Building relationships
  * Exchanging information (mutual benefits)
  * Expanding both of your networks
* Become a referral candidate

**Slide #9:**

#### The Who
Who should you reach out to from a company?

* Any warm contacts
* Software developers
  * Juniors vs. seniors
  * Engineering managers
* Recruiters
* Where do you find them?
  * Company page
  * LinkedIn

**Slide #10:**

#### The What
Start with Research

Then, what do you say in your message?

* Introduction (who are you?)
* Purpose/Connection (why are you reaching out?)
* Specifics (what do you know about the contact? What do you know about the company?)
* Questions (what do you want to know?)

**Slide #11:**

Do not:

* Ask for referrals without establishing relationships
* Ask for a job
* Send a LinkedIn request with no introduction
* Use a generic template that hasn't been customized

**Slide #12:**

#### How to Send the Message: Email vs. LinkedIn
Whenever possible, find your contact's email (or use Slack if they're in the Turing network!). Why? Unless you're actively job searching or actively hiring, people may not be checking their LinkedIn regularly and might miss your message. Also, LinkedIn messages have a limited number of characters you can use. Instead try some of the following tools to find your contact's email:

* Tools for finding emails:
  * [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
  * [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
  * [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
  * [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
  * [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
  * [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
  * [Snov.io](https://snov.io/)
  * [Go Pin Leads](https://www.gopinleads.com/)
  * GitHub
  * Personal website

**Facilitator #2:** Using Slides #13-18, go through the following:

**Slide #13:** Facilitator calls on 2 student volunteers to come to the front to walk you through the following, which you should display on the main screen. You may need to prompt students to utilize the tools we've discussed in previous sessions and provide guidance along the way.

### Whole Group Practice
Let's have 2 volunteers to walk us through this process:

* Find a posting.
* Find 1 person at the company to reach out to.
* How can we do research on them? What do we say in the message?
* How do we contact them?

Repeat this process with volunteer #2.

**Slide #14:**

#### Whole Group Debrief
Facilitator calls on 2-3 students to answer this question:

* What should you keep in mind when executing outreach tied to a job posting?

**Slide #16:**

### Partner Practice
With a partner, using 1 position you posted to your Huntr board last week:

* Find and research a contact
* Find their contact information
* Draft a message to them

Facilitator: after this group practice, call on 2 groups to share out who they're reaching out to, why, and what they'll say.

**Slide #18**
