### Setting up your Alumni Portfolio -- Welcome to Terminal!
Turing provides a space for professional portfolios on our website. Employers come to this part of our site to find candidates, and we also share these with employers who come to us asking for candidates. The terminal also functions as a job board -- this is where the job postings in #job-hunt come from!

* You should receive an email inviting you to set up your terminal profile. If you do not have the invitation sent from employment@turing.edu, please contact the Mod 3 Lead Career Specialist.

How to Set It Up
Log into Terminal at https://terminal.turing.edu/developers/sign_in
Go to “Edit Profile” from the account menu
Fill out the profile until all sections are complete
Click “Request Review”
Staff members will review your profile and approve it for publishing or request additional changes
For more info on how to set this up, [watch this demo](](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqHrdkr0B5wEvEaH9Z8dJK56TcSJoV_t/view))
Once published, your profile will be visible on the main alumni directory at terminal.turing.edu as long as you are participating in job search support until you get your first job. While you are actively job searching, the Career Dev team will use your portfolio in referrals to companies.

### Terminal Portfolio: What Should Be Included
What needs to be included for your portfolio to be published? Here is what the team is looking for:

Your Developer Title
* Professional-looking photo
* This should be a photo of just you (no kids or animals, sorry!)
* Use the same photo as your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles if possible
* Don't have a professional-looking photo? Check out this post for tips on how to take one at home

About Me Description
 * Tell your professional story -- what is your story about your past, present, and future that you want to share with employers? Make sure to answer these questions: who am I? Why am I in this field? What’s next for me?
 * Consider how this is consistent with your LinkedIn and overall brand.
 * If you’re struggling with writing this and need additional support, please contact your mentor and/or members of the career development team. Check out your peers’ About Me sections to see what you like and don’t like on Terminal
 * Make sure to have someone else review this section for clarity, spelling, and grammar
