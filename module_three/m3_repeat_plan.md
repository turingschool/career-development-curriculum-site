title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 3
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

During your time in Mod 3 PD, we focused on building these core competencies:

* Utilize community for support in job search
* Continue utilizing mentor for job search support
* Apply strategies to personal job search

By the end of Module 3, we aim for students to achieve [Level III readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Interviewing, Materials, and Job Search Strategies. While you repeat the module, this is an opportunity to continue this work and think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

## Expectations for Repeating the Module

### Sessions
You are **not** required to attend the rest of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the weekly sessions:

* Week 1: [Resumes & Portfolios](
* Week 2: [Building Connection: Part II](
* Week 3: [The Application Process](/module_three/week_3_application_process_session)

**Please let Robyn Purvin (@robynp) know if you would like to participate in Job Shadow this module.**

### Homeroom Groups
You will be added to a new homeroom group with your new cohort. This is an opportunity to build new networking relationships, support each other with professional development and the job search, and connect with each other. 

During homeroom group time, some of the discussion topics will pertain to the session for that week. Even though you do not have to attend the sessions, you should contribute your ideas and reflections to the group and use the space to solicit feedback and collaboration on what you're working on. 

Reminder on [Homeroom Group expectations](/student_discussion_groups/).
