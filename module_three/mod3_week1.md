### Section 1: Resume Review

As you start to think about your resume, your career vision will serve as a foundation. You can't build an effective resume until you know what story you want it to tell. And we'll start here by addressing a common misconception that resumes should be one-size-fits-all. Not only should you customize your resume for each job you apply to, but your resume should also be a **direct reflection of your job search strategy.** 

#### Technical Resumes Lead with Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are an essential -- arguably, the **most** essential -- part of your new resume. You should include:

* Turing projects
* Side projects
* Open Source projects
* Etc.

You should include links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

Your descriptions for your projects should tell an employer what the project is and what is does in as few words as possible. The rest of the description should be about accomplishments from that project and value added. What was your role in the project? What specific goals did you meet?

#### Customizing Your Resume is About Telling Your Story
Reminder that you should **always** customize your resume to the position for which you're applying. To make sure your resume is customized, pay attention to 3 things:

1. Telling your story through a summary statement
2. Showcasing specific projects
3. Highlight transferable skills

We recommend using a summary statement on your new resume so that you can:

1. Describe why you've made a career change
2. Make a connection between the company you're applying to and the work you do/want to do

Again, your projects can be used to your advantage to tell a specific story to this company as well. Showcase the projects that use the same tech stack, relate to a similar product, demonstrate your interest in their work, or showcase teamwork that is similar to the company you're applying to. A great idea is to build a project using a company's tech stack -- you'll discuss this more in-depth with Ian in his workshop.

And lastly, highlight your most relevant transferable skills -- both technical and professional -- that relate to this particular company.

#### Creating an ATS-ready Resume
An ATS, or applicant tracking system, is used by most companies to screen resumes. Each ATS system is different and **it's important to always follow the directions for that specific company**, but there are a few key components to keep in mind when creating a resume that is optimized for ATS systems:

* Use a Word doc or a Google Doc (which can be downloaded as a Word doc) to use as your main copy. Not all ATS systems can read PDFs.
* Use a single column. 
* Compare your resume to the job description and pull out key words to highlight in your skills and experience
* Need some inspiration? Check out these [free resume templates from JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-templates)

For a more "stylized" resume to use in your [Terminal portfolio](https://terminal.turing.edu) or to send via email as a PDF, [check out the templates listed here](/resources/resume_resources).

#### Other Important Reminders
When building your resume, make sure to keep this checklist handy as well:

* Double check your spelling, grammar, and readability. How? Read it out loud to yourself to hear how it sounds AND ask a peer or mentor to read it also. As with coding, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes on something.
* Do not lie. This is important. Expect to be asked about **anything** that is listed on your resume. If your resume does not accurately represent you, you will not get this job, and it will hurt your chances at that company in the future.
* List work and education in chronological order. If you're concerned about gaps in your employment, list the length of time at a position rather than the dates.
* Include your contact information. Email is absolutely needed, but you can also include your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. There are differing opinions on phone numbers, but you can decide at your own discretion.
* Don't include a headshot -- it will take up valuable space and it's not a norm in this industry.
* Your resume should only be 1 page. Employers will not read past that 1 page.
* There are a lot of templates you can use, but be conservative with colors. Consider readability and printability.
* Don't list your special interests or hobbies. They don't belong on a technical resume. Instead, you can put them on your LinkedIn profile.

### Section 2: Set up your Terminal Portfolio

Turing provides a space for professional portfolios on [our website](https://terminal.turing.edu). Employers come to this part of our site to find candidates, and we also share these with employers who come to us asking for candidates. Terminal also functions as a job board -- this is where the job postings in #job-hunt come from!

#### How to Set It Up
* Log into Terminal at [https://terminal.turing.edu/developers/sign_in](https://terminal.turing.edu/developers/sign_in)
* Go to “Edit Profile” from account menu
* Fill out profile until all sections are complete
* Click “Request Review”
* Staff member will review your profile and approve for publishing or request additional changes
* For more info on how to set this up, [watch this demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqHrdkr0B5wEvEaH9Z8dJK56TcSJoV_t/view)

Once published, your profile will be visible on the main alumni directory at [terminal.turing.edu](https://terminal.turing.edu) as long as you are participating in job search support until you get your first job. While you are actively job searching, the Career Dev team will use your portfolio in referrals to companies. 

## Application
### Resume Review Activity
Look at a few different resumes on [Terminal](https://terminal.turing.edu) and consider:

* How are they telling their story through their resume?
* How are they describing their projects? What would you do similarly or differently?
* What makes them stand out as a candidate compared to others?

Now, work on your resume draft that you started last mod:
* Build your resume using [these templates and checklist](/resources/resume_resources)
* Upload it to CV Compiler, which is an ATS system we partner with that will provide you with feedback on your resume (further instructions on the session's slides).
* Update your resume using that feedback

### Set up you Terminal Portfolio Draft
Reminder to check out this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqHrdkr0B5wEvEaH9Z8dJK56TcSJoV_t/view)

###  About me section for Terminal Portfolio:
What do you want your profile to say about you? Write out a rough draft of your professional story considering using this framework:

* What is your career story about your past, present, and future that you want to share with employers? 
* What prior experiences are relevant and transferrabe to the tech industry?
* What impact you want to have in software development?
* What kind of company and culture are you passionate about adding value for?

### Answer the following questions:
* Who am I? 
* Why am I in this field? 
* What's next for me? 

Show readers who you are by telling a story of your journey into tech. Share enough for them to want to hear and learn more! 

Your Terminal about me section, LinkedIn summary, and resume summary (if you chose to use one) should all be slightly different. 
* First, you want the reader to learn something new with each profile
* Second, each summary has a different purpose; think about the audience
  * Resume summaries should tell why you are the best candidate for the role relevant to the job description. 
  * LinkedIn summaries allows you to add a personal touch in addition to relevant skills and experiences that will attract recruiters and hiring managers.
  * Terminal is similiar to the LinkedIn audience; employers want to know your backstory, your value proposition and what's next for you as a developer.
