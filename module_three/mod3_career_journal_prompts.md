1. Refine your career vision: What are the values that will drive your job search? What are your goals for your job search? What kind of role do you see yourself pursuing in your job search? Based on your latest version of your career vision, list the top 3-5 industries and companies you'll pursue in your job search as of right now. Why did you pick these industries/companies? How do they relate to the values and goals you have for yourself in your job search?

2. Build your resume

* Pick a template from those listed in the Templates section [here](/resources/resume_resources)

   * Header (Name + Software Developer OR Back End Engineer OR Front End Engineer, etc.)
   * Contact info
   * Summary
   * Skills
   * Projects
   * Experience

5. Ian's workshop this week is designed to help you break down your interest in specific industries even further by exploring their tech stacks to decide if you want to utilize any of their tools in upcoming projects. Make a copy of his [template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ncn2w6l3SaXOM71ZHcBPutxCoFOhHNlDa56Xuzz0SHs/edit?usp=sharing) and post a link to your copy here to show what research you've completed. You can also link this research to your Huntr board.

### Mod 3 Week 2: The Application Process  <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Find a position or use a position you've put on your Huntr board and write a cover letter for that position in a Google doc or gist. Reference these [cover letter resources](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/cover_letter_resources.md) as well as [the session](https://careerdev.turing.io/module_three/week_2_application_process) to complete your cover letter. 
* Post the link to your cover letter here

2. Review your cover letter with a peer some time this week. What feedback did your partner give you? What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?

3. If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? What other next steps would you need to take here?

### Mod 3 Week 3: Outreach & Networking II <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Back to your resume and cover letter you've been working on:
* What other next steps do you want to take to make these two components stronger?

2. Outreach Brainstorming:
* Either explore the company you wrote a cover letter for or find a new company to explore this week; Go to their company LinkedIn page and start to explore the employees. Who are a couple people you could reach out to? Why? 

3. Finalize Your Plan:  
* Who have you decided to reach out to? Why that person? How will you contact them? What do you want to talk to them about? How will you follow up?

4. Execute your plan:
* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.
