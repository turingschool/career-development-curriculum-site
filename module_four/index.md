**The following are general guidelines for repeating a module:
   * Attend the Intro to PD session for updates and important information for the cohort. 
   * Participate in House and Mix It Up groups.
   * Submit a new self-evaluation based on current PD activities and reflections during the Mod.
   * Meet all graduation requirements.
   * If you attended all required sessions before, it is optional to participate in them again. 
   * Exit tickets completed previously do not need to be submitted again.
