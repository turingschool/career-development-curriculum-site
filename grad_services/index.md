Graduating from Turing is a huge accomplishment! However, your Turing journey isn't complete until you secure your first technical job, and our team is here to continue to support you!

## Calendar
The New Graduate Services Events Calendar provides information for upcoming group check-ins, guest speakers, and any additional events for job seekers. 

**Reading the Calendar**
Events that are lead by Turing Staff or a Guest Speaker will be noted with ðŸŽ¥.  You can expect these sessions to be guided.

Events that are noted with ðŸ“† are times that meant to be used for student collaboration in the New Grad Services Study Hall.  The zoom information for that room is pinned to the #employment-round-one slack channel!
