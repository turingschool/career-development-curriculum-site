### So You've Done All The Turing Projects...

Now it's time to run your own technical project - with some support from Turing staff!  The best way that we can help you is by providing some accountability as you work on a solo or small group project.

So, to participate in this project space we will expect you to follow these guidelines:

#### Guidelines
* Projects will be split into Ideation and Implementation phases.
  * Once you have decided on an idea, that is what you will implement!
  * If you want to change ideas, save it for another project!
  * It is okay if the _scope_ of your project changes ðŸ˜‰
* You will maintain **documentation**
  * Calendar, including standups and worktime
  * DTR if you are in a group!
  * Project Planning: ideation documents, project board, standup and retro notes
  * Github Readme with GOOD project documentation
* You will schedule 3 checkins with your Project Manager throughout the inning
  * If you are working on a solo project, you may schedule time with your accountabilibuddy.
  * For 2405, your project manager is Megan McMahon, and you can book time on her calender [HERE](https://go.oncehub.com/MeganMcMahon)
* You will submit a video presentation of your project for the whole group to celebrate! We will organize this in the #2403-new-grad-project slack channel.

#### Expectations
* Ideation
  * If you are in a group, you will submit a DTR to your project manager by Friday of week 1
  * You will submit documents outlining you MVP, Wireframes, and User Stories by Friday of week 2
* Implementation
  * Each working day of implementation will start with a standup; each standup should be documented so that your Project Manager can keep an eye on your progress.
  * Each week you will have a group or solo retro to reflect and plan on any changes for the next week.  You will document your retro notes for your Project Manager.

### Project Ideas
