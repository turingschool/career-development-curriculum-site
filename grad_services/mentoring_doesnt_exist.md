Today let's explore the topic of growth over your first six months in your job.

## The Interview

* They're scared of you, you're scared of them
* Mitigating risk
* Trigger words/phrases: mentoring, pairing, work/life balance, leave, TDD
* Care about those topics, but try to avoid being first
* If you "need" things they don't have you're poking their insecurities
* Ask questions about growth like:
  * How do developers on the team get better at their job?
  * How do technical people learn to be good managers?
  * Why did the last three developers leave the team?

### Quick Practice

* Look back at your last two cover letters. Did they possible trigger any insecurities of the employer?
* Write down three additional questions you could ask to learn about a company's culture of growth/learning

## The First Month

* You're not yet that valuable
* You don't *deserve* anything
* You want to break the stereotypes
* "Mentoring" is a nice idea and almost impossible in practice
* Be *smart* about asking questions:
  * Please don't ever say "it doesn't work"
  * 1) What were you trying to do?
  * 2) What were you expecting to happen?
  * 3) What happened instead?
  * 4) What have you attempted/read to find a solution?
* Time is your friend -- if you use it well
* Timeshifting: Boomerang, revising commits, etc
* Build impressions + results in equal weight
* Be the first follower
* First in, but with caution

### Quick Practice

* Joey, get a calendar for god's sake.
* You should get in the habit of tracking and critiquing how your time is spent. Signup *now* for a time-tracking tool [like Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/)
* What routines are you following *now*? This is your *discipline*. Break out your calendar and timebox the rest of this week and all of next week. When will you wake up? Exercise? Do outreach? Technical practice? It's ok to change the plan later, but having no plan is a shit plan.

## Six Month Arc

* No one will build a plan for you
* *IF YOU DON'T MAKE A PLAN YOU WON'T GET FAR*
* Start at the end
* Map backwards to the starting point
* Share it with your supervisor, invite them to participate
* Share it with your peers and invite them to join
* Build a portfolio of progress
  * Individual Work/Learning
  * Team Work/Learning
  * Professional Skills
  * Feedback & Community
* The power of anecdotal records
* Tracking progress forces *you* to confront your own growth
* The best way to attack imposter syndrome, lack of confidence, etc
* Your records are your leverage for future negotiating

### Quick Practice

* Look back at your Mod1 portfolio at Turing. Remember that young whippersnapper all full of energy and vigor? What does that portfolio tell you about what's possible in a few weeks of high effort?
* Tomorrow the offer arrives for your dream job. You start on the first of next month, hooray! Where will you be six months later. What specific skills will you be better at? What will you understand or be able to do? What will you have achieved?
