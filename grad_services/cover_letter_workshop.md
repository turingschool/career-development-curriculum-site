In this session, participants will be able to:

* Practice writing cover letters
* Give and receive feedback on cover letters
* Implement changes and new learnings into a cover letter draft in order to submit it

### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
**Opening questions:** Why do we write cover letters? What is the purpose? What should it include?

Discuss the answers to these questions for 5 minutes

#### Keep these things in mind:

* Keep your cover letters to 1 page. 2-3 paragraphs is standard.
* Here are some suggested ways to structure the letter:
  * Paragraph #1: Introduce yourself -- *briefly.*
      * Explain why you are applying for the position and include some research into the company
      * Give a brief version of your professional story; why does this company and this position specifically fit into your next step in your career?
      * Consider including a **hook** to connect to the reader and give a sense of your personality
      * If you have any connection at the company, mention them here
  * Paragraph #2: Highlight your skills specific to the job posting
      * This is *not* a rehashing of your resume. Rather, what do you want the reader to notice about your resume? What extra detail can you provide here?
      * Go more in-depth about a certain project or discuss an example of how you've done similar work to what the company is looking for
  * Paragraph #3: Connect the first two paragraphs by talking about how you are the best fit to build *value* for the company
      * This letter is about helping the company see how you uniquely will help them meet their goals. Paint that picture for them. Emphasize how you will not only flourish in this role but you also have the drive and ability to keep growing professionally, take on more responsibility, and benefit the company in ways beyond the initial position for which you're applying.
      * How can you apply your background and skills to make great experiences for the company's users/customers? What can you leave them with that will make them want to contact you?
      * Include information about your availability for interviews and/or references if applicable

That being said, this template is more like an outline to keep in mind when structuring your thoughts. **The most important thing is that the cover letter has your unique voice and does not come across like a generic copy.** Furthermore, the cover letter should be a good balance between assertively selling yourself and keeping the company and its goals at the forefront.

### We Do
As a whole group, we'll find a job posting and write a cover letter together. We'll discuss:

* What do we notice in the job description that stands out to us?
* What can we pull out to discuss in the cover letter?
* What research should we do?
* How can we use our professional story here?

Facilitator: Go around the group and ask multiple students what they would focus on in terms of their professional stories and projects that they've worked on for this particular position.

If there's time, look at another posting and repeat.

#### Optional: Review a participant's cover letter as Whole Group
If participants have brought cover letters with them, ask for one of them to read theirs aloud to the group and/or display it for the group to discuss using these questions:

* Do we know what position is being applied for?
* What do we know about this person as an individual? As a programmer?
* How do we know theyâ€™re qualified for this position?
* What connections have they made to the company?

### Workshop Time
Participants write a cover letter for the job posting that they brought with them to the session or continue refining a cover letter they've brought.  

### Round of Feedback
Each participant will get 5 minutes to spend on their cover letter to get feedback from the group. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.**

For larger groups, participants can be broken up into multiple smaller groups, with a max of 8 people per group.

### Revision Time
Use the next 10 minutes to revise your cover letter according to feedback you received and then send in your application.

### Closing
Debrief as a whole group:

* What are you taking away from today's session?
